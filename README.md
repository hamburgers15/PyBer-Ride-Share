# PyBer-Ride-Share

## Overview
This analysis uses Python to create a DataFrame of ride-sharing data that is broken down by city type. In the end we are trying to find the weekly fares by city type and determine how that will effect the creation of a new ride-share app.

Urban cities use ride share services far more offten then suburban or rural towns.  Urban cities take 1000 more rides, have just under 2000 more drivers and make a twice the amount then suburban and rural combined.  For the drivers the major difference between rural, suburban and urban is the price per ride.  The smaller the town the higher the average fare per ride.

## Summary
I would make three recomendations for someone planing to start a ride-share app.
- Having less drivers in the urban cities would allow those drivers to make more overall and they would be happier to continue working.
- The start of the year appears to be a low income time for all city types.  It would be a good idea to offer a premotion to the customers to get more people out in the cold weather.
- Decreasing fares in rural towns would allow more people to use ride-shares.  Ave.fare per ride is high in the rural towns because the ride are likly longer.  This is a high cost of entery to new clients.
